# Random Password Generator

This is a simple web application that generates random passwords based on user-selected criteria. The user can choose the length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters) and whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters.

## Installation

To use this application, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. No additional installation is required.

## Usage

To generate a password, open the index.html file in your web browser and click the "Generate Password" button. The application will prompt you to select the length of the password and which criteria to include. Once you've made your selections, the application will generate a random password and display it in the text box.

If you want to generate another password, simply click the "Generate Password" button again.

## Technical Details

This application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The password generation logic is contained in the generatePassword() function, which selects random characters from arrays of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters based on the user's criteria.

The application uses event listeners to respond to user input and update the password display in real time. It also includes error checking to ensure that the user selects at least one criteria and that the password length is within the allowed range.
